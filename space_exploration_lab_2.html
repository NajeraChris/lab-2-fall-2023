        <p>
            On august 15th, 1983 stanford university send out radio signals depicting life on earth in the form of 13 drawings. These drawings depict things slike our social constructs and the theory of evolution, drawings we hope a recipient may understand and even reply to. The further into space
            that we attempt to observe, the less we can see. Additionally, far into space we have observed potentially hospitable planets in distant solar systems, and for a radio signal to reach there and to recieve a reply would've taken about 40 years. Therefore. now 40 years later in 2023 we are
            anxiously awaiting a potential response that could possibly come any day now.
